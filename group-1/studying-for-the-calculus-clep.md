# Studying for the Calculus CLEP

### My background with Math/CLEP

For background, I started studying Calculus August of last year (2020) for about 1-2 months before taking a break for 2 months, then reviewing/filling gaps for a month and taking the CLEP in December. Before August I hadn't touched ANY math in 10 years, I also had issues with Trig, (still have) some with Algebra, had a shit time with pre-calc in high school. I say all this to give confidence that Calculus is possible to make sense of and learn competently with the right approach and care.

One cool thing about Calculus was I thought math wasn't useful mainly because it didn't make sense why we were learning all these math techniques. Calculus unifies these techniques and thus gives us a reason to learn all that other stuff. In general, Calculus is apparently used is EVERYTHING, so it won't hurt you to learn (probably).

#### **For actual studying** I'll advise two chunks.

1\. Learn how to run through the test, 2. Run through the test and see where Calculus beats you up.

## Part One: Taking the Tests

Note: I'm building off of this guy's test taking strategy (https://www.reddit.com/r/clep/comments/jn765j/pass\_clep\_calculus\_with\_72\_my\_test\_strategies/) of how to actually take the test, which, in a nutshell, is:

**-1st round:** Answer only the questions you can get easily/using little calculations, the low hanging fruit. SKIP ONES THAT TAKE A WHILE

**-2nd round:** Come back for the harder ones that you can do that take more time SKIP THE ONES YOU WON'T GET

**-3rd round:** With last 2-3 minutes make educated guesses on the Q's you WILL NOT get (which I admit, there were more than I wanted to do so)

### Key point on scoring:

**You don't get penalized for wrong answers;** make sure ALL Q's have an answer.

### Key point on confidence:

On the practice test there are 60 Q's given, but the highest number you can get correct is 40.....odd. You're not "_meant_" to get all of them correct (or at least it doesn't help you if you do.) My first practice run through I got \~33% correct (I felt awful) which translates to about 22 Q's correct. On this grading scale though that gave me a 57, which is passing.

Note: Some of these questions are placed as a test to see if they need to make the tests easier/harder. This is helpful to know if you get discouraged from the amount of questions you "don't know".

## Part Two: Finding failure points

Next thing I'd recommend doing is comparing your current level of knowledge with what is likely to be on the CLEP. This may make you feel bad, but don't freak out!! You're still a fine person.

#### How are we to do this?

\-Find out what's going to be on the test (PRACTICE TEST, links below)

\-Doing a run through (see [Part One](studying-for-the-calculus-clep.md#part-one-taking-the-tests)), as if it were the real test and write out (or type out) your answers. (This does give you practice for the test-taking method so you don't freak out when the actual punches start flying.)

\-Afterwards (take a break if you need), go back through and see if you can classify the questions you got right and wrong. **This is how you know what you have down and what you need to work on next.** THIS IS YOUR GUIDE TO STUDY FROM NOW TILL YOUR TEST. If you're unsure what type of problem something is, Google helps as do friends (feel free to reach out!!).

\-Finally, don't worry about being able to do EVERYTHING on the test, "Do less, better." Since you've got your categories of the questions you got wrong (right!?) you can count how many you would've gotten right had you known those techniques and get a rough idea of how many, and what, topics you need to study. (This isn't perfect as the test will be structured differently, just plan on getting enough so you have room for error and you'll be fine.)

## Notes for actually Studying:

Take your time with each chunk you're learning. It's not going to do you good if you rush through each section trying to get as much as you can; real knowledge needs to take root if it's going to withstand the weather of difficult tests/problems.

Generally the schedule should go; Learn a new topic, UNDERSTAND IT, test yourself on it, then review.

I'd recommend "acquiring" only one topic at a time. Though while reviewing you can do while you go onto multiple topics (which is the point, not to have only one object in mind at a time but instead can move freely between them.)

For review (PLEASE DON'T SKIP, I spent way too much time thinking that I had it down and then was sorry), flash cards are the bomb. I did 10-15 minutes when I first woke up and right before bed (more or less) and was able to keep a good amount in for the test.

## Structure of the test itself:

There's two sections, both timed, BUT when you finish the first section it'll brief you on how to take the second second and in that breifing **your timer is not running.**

Two things about this, 1. Go to the bathroom, slow your breath down, etc. I took 5 minutes in between to chill and I'm VERY glad I did. 2. Get familiar with the calculator (if you didn't do so before (https://ibt2calc.ets.org/))

Number of Questions: I think one section has 28 and the next has 18, can't remember though. It's a weird number though.
